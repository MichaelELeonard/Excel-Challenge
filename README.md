## Background

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.
To receive funding, projects must meet or exceed an initial funding goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources to discover “tricks” from past success campaigns. For this challenge, we organized and analyzed a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends of success.

## Data Analysis of Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding has transformed and expanded the financial opportunities startup companies are able to utilize to fund the next big idea. As crowdfunding grows in importance and popularity, it is critical to examine data trends to establish patterns that organizations can utilize to increase their opportunity to successfully promote their product. 

DATA ANAYLSIS INC. has started a small batch data analysis of 1000 crowdfunding campaigns to look for common traits that can lead to the next business success story. Initial analysis has provided to following data:

## Initial Analysis Observations

Initial analysis of the data shows three potential conclusions regarding crowdfunding campaigns:

* Endeavors that directly engage with their audience are frequently crowdfunded funded at higher levels, leading to an increase in successful outcomes. Examples of these endeavors include Film & Video, Music, and Theater projects.

* Theater projects were funded was significantly higher rates in this data set. As theater, film & video, music projects historically have people gather to experience the product collectively, these patrons may be more inclined to support future crowdsourcing endeavors. 

* Crowdsourced projects consistently succeed at a higher rate than they fail within this limited data set.

## Potential limitations of this data set
As with all data analysis, this data set may have limitations to keep in mind when conducting data analysis. Potential limitations may include:

* Bias withing the data that may skew the data analysis?
* How might the limited sample size affect the preliminary results?
* Does this data set include outliers that may skew the statistical analysis?

## Future Tables/Graphs that may provide additional insight


As this is a preliminary report examining trends that may lead to successful crowdsourcing campaigns, future tables and graphs may need to establish a deeper analysis to identify variables that may influence successful campaigns. Future table/graphs to consider include:   

* Analysis of a larger data sample may provide a more in-depth understanding of successful crowdsourcing campaigns.

* Examining the data of successful crowdsourcing campaigns within the historical boom & bust cycles of the larger economy may establish the role that economic cycles play in the success or failure of crowdsourcing campaigns.

* Including a local/regional economic analysis within our data set could further examine how local/regional economic trends may affect the success and failure rates of crowdsourcing campaigns on a local level.
