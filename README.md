## Background

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.
To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this challenge, we will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

## Data Analysis of Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding has transformed and expanded the financial opportunities that startup companies are able to utilize to fund the next big idea. As crowdfunding grows in importance and popularity, it is critical to examine data trends to establish patterns that organizations can utilize to increase their opportunity to successfully promote their product. 

DATA ANAYLSIS INC. has started a small batch data analysis of 1000 crowdfunding situations to examine trends that can be used to establish the next business success story. Initial analysis has provided to following data outlined below:

### Pivot Table showing outcomes based on launch date

## Initial Analysis Observations

Initial analysis of the data shows three potential conclusions regarding crowdfunding campaigns:

* Creative endeavors that directly engage with their audience are frequently crowdfunded funded at higher levels, leading to an increase in successful outcomes. Examples of these endeavors include Film & Video, Music, and Theater projects.

* Theater projects were funded at a significantly higher rate than all the other crowdfunded opportunities examined in this data set. As theater, film & video, music projects historically have people gather to experience the product as a group, those patrons may be more inclined to support future crowdsourcing endeavors. 

* Crowdsourced projects consistently succeed at a higher rate than they fail within this data set.

## Potential limitations of this dataset
As with all data analysis, this data set may have potential limitations that should be considered when attempting to provide data analysis:

* What types of bias were incorporated within our data, and how might it skew the data analysis?
* How might the limited sample size affect the preliminary results?
* Does this dataset include outliers that may skew the statistical analysis?

## Future Tables/Graphs that may provide additional insight


As this is just a preliminary report examining trends that can lead to successful crowdsourcing campaigns, future tables and graphs will need to be established to provide deeper analysis into the variables that can influence successful campaigns. Future table/graphs that could be considered and the insights they might provide include:   

* Analysis of a much larger data sample may provide a much more in-depth understanding of successful crowdsourcing campaigns.

* By expanding the data sample of crowdsourcing campaigns and comparing it with the historical boom & bust cycles within the larger economy, a more in-depth understanding can be obtained regarding the role that economic cycles play in the success or failure of crowdsourcing campaigns.

* Including a regional economic analysis within our data set could further examine how regional economic trends may affect the success and failure rates of crowdsourcing campaigns on a local level.
